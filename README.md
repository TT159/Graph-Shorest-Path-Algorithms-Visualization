# Graph-Shorest-Path-Algorithms-Visualization

This is a coursework project. This project is aimed to implement the visualization of three algorithms of finding the shortest path in a graph. 
We want to implement the visualization in two ways: static visualization and web-based dynamic visualization. 
For a given input, in static visualization, the output will be the constructed graph with the shortest path marked. 
In the second part, we generated an animated display which can generate and modify graphs with given input, show every step of the algorithms automatically and run algorithms step by step. 
At the same time, it will also display the vertix list and weight of the path on the right.

## Static Visualization. </br>
The first part of this project is to visualize the final shortest path after being applied to the algorithm. 
We have completely implemented this part.
## Dynamic visualization. </br> 
The second part is to animatedly visualize the process of finding the shortest path step by step. 
For this part, due to the limited time, we only implement Dijkstra's algorithm.
